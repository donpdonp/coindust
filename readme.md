### Coindust

Coindust is a command-line bitcoin wallet and utility.

Coindust performs common bitcoin operations where key storage is local (see Safety section below) and interacting with the bitcoin blockchain is done through public Bitcoin APIs.

In the early days of bitcoin (2013) it was common to host a full node. Today(2015) the requirements of running a full node and high - many hours of initial syncing and 10s of gigabytes of disk. Cell phone cryptocoin apps have shown keeping private keys local and using public APIs can be a great way to use Bitcoin.

### Install

```sh
$ npm install -g coindust
```

### Usage

* Add a new bitcoin address and private key to the wallet using an optional account name.
```
$ coindust new comic books

priv: L3YfxDBDrYAXL7U7eFWaxTejheCG3Cf7MKGRjUjXRgEZDF5h3c4X
name: "comic books"
```

* Query the balances of addresses in the wallet [1]

```
$ coindust balance
gathering balances for 2 keys

```
$ coindust 1AVrK8LZeKxvnrT3AiyZ3uvceYTdNyNELf
gathering balances for 1 keys
1AVrK8LZeKxvnrT3AiyZ3uvceYTdNyNELf 0.00000000 BTC
Total: 0 BTC
```

* Build a transaction between two bitcoin addresses [2]

*Note*: this builds the transaction and displays it in hex form. _It does not submit the transaction_.

```
$ coindust tx --in 1Q182Kx8y7gkXvvEod8nwt5gDDa86Dr2tv --out 1MXEaXamNSLUXQKWZu8fSz241Zginvoj1m --amount 0.0008

  tx size:                               372 bytes

Hex encoded transaction:

```

The hex form of the transaction can be pasted it into a blockchain service which will submit the transaction into the bitcoin network. Decode and inspect the transaction to verify its correctness. [4]

[1] Uses blockexplorer.com to get a balance from a bitcoin address.

[2] Uses blockchain.info to discover the 'unspent outputs' of the 'in' address.

[3] Uses 21.co for a recommened fee rate

* Use tx --sweep to empty the address (sets amount to address total after fee)

```
$ coindust tx --in 1Q182Kx8y7gkXvvEod8nwt5gDDa86Dr2tv --out 1MXEaXamNSLUXQKWZu8fSz241Zginvoj1m --sweep
```
